# [ðŸ“š Software APIs](https://libhal.github.io/libarmcortex/api)

Drivers for ARM cortex-m series micro-controllers. Currently supports:

* Cortex-M3
* Cortex-M4
* Cortex-M7

# Setup

## [Installing libhal prereqs](https://libhal.github.io/setup/)

## Installing ARM Cortex M cross compiler

> NOTE: These install steps are not the only possible way to install these
> binaries, just that these are very easy ways to install these prereqs.

> Required ARM cross compiler is `arm-none-eabi-g++` version 11.0 or above

### Installation on Mac OSX

```
brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded
```

### Installation on Linux (untested)

`apt` no longer keeps the ARM GCC compilers up to date and tend to lag version
releases by a year or two. Instead we have a custom made installer script
written in python that downloads the cross compiler from ARM Developers site

```
# TBD
```

### Windows

Click this link to download the Windows toolchain installer.

[arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe?rev=674f6ef06614499dad033db88c3452b3&hash=B2AAC9DBE66448116B07ED6C0BB7B71EAD875426)

NOTE: At the end of the installation program make sure to check the box for
"Add to PATH environment variable". If this is not done, the compiler will not
be executable from the command line. If this happens, re-run the installer and
check the box.

This executable along with others others can be found here:
https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads.

### Verifying Installation

To check the version run the command `arm-none-eabi-g++ --version`. It should
look like this:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-g++ --version
arm-none-eabi-g++ (Arm GNU Toolchain 11.3.Rel1) 11.3.1 20220712
